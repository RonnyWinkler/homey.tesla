Log your vehicle data, air conditioning before driving or optimize charging...
Countless ways to make your Tesla even smarter and integrate it into your smart home.

Setup:
Add your vehicle as a device. Sign in with your Tesla account.
Once added, you have the option to register the app in your vehicle to send commands to the vehicle.
You can then add additional devices to control specific vehicle functions (climate, charging...).

For energy devices, first add the EnergySite device. Then add dependent devices such as batteries and solar panels.

API notes:
This app uses the Tesla Fleet API. This supports end-to-end encryption of the commands sent to the vehicle.
To use this app, you need a Tesla developer account. Documentation is available in the pair view.
In order to send commands to the vehicle, the app must be registered in the vehicle. To do this, use the call when adding the vehicle or carry out this step later in the repair dialog.
Adding as a vehicle key may be restricted if you are not the owner but the vehicle is registered to the lessor.

Tesla API pricing (examples for €):
10€ free/month.
Costs:
- 1000 command = 1€
- 500 data requests = 1€
- 50 wake requests = 1€
For higher usage you can add a subscription.
